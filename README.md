Description
-----------

It allows users to send video frames from openFrameworks.

You may be better off using [ofxSyphon](https://github.com/astellato/ofxSyphon) to share video frames and OSC to send messages back and forth.  But, if you need to use [jit.net.send]/[jit.net.recv] then this is your addon.

OpenFrameworks is a cross platform open source toolkit for creative coding in C++.
